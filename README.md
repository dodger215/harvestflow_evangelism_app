## 🌈 Animated Flow (Concept)

```
Add Members ➜ Create Meetings ➜ Add Souls ➜ Send SMS ➜ Track Growth 🌾
```

To visualize this process, you can add a short animation or app demo GIF later.
For now, you can use a placeholder like this in your GitHub:

```markdown
![App Flow Animation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/animated-webdev/flame-flow/main/animation-line.gif)
```

### 💡 Notes for GitHub:
- Rename your image files if you prefer shorter names (and update the paths accordingly).  
- The animated line GIF is just a visual placeholder — you can replace it later with your own app demo GIF or Lottie animation.  
- Everything here is **Markdown-compliant** and displays perfectly on GitHub’s web view.

Would you like me to generate a simple **animated app flow GIF** (logo → features → slogan) for you to embed in this README?
